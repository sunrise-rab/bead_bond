# Bead Bond

Bead Bond is a creative, child-focused web application designed for children aged 5 years and over to explore the joy of beading. Families and schools can book free creative sessions where children create jewellery using colourful beads in a safe and supportive environment.

The aim of Bead Bond is to help children grow in confidence, build friendships, and enjoy meaningful bonding time through creativity. The platform also supports community involvement through donation-based funding.

## Rationale

Bead Bond was inspired by a young girl very close to me. Beading helped her become more confident, creative, and socially connected. She would spend hours making bracelets and sharing them with other girls, building friendships through creativity.

This project was created to bring that same sense of healing, joy, and connection to other children and families. Many children especially those who have experienced trauma, anxiety, or isolation benefit from creative, hands-on activities. Beading supports fine motor skills, focus, self-expression, and emotional wellbeing while encouraging positive social interaction.

Bead Bond also promotes family involvement, school wellbeing, and community support through free workshops funded by donations.
